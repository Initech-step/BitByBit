# PROJECT NAME: BitByBit
Project type: Prototype.

## Reason/Purpose why this project was developed
On February 14, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) embarked on a nationwide strike. 
The strike has lasted for seven (7) months and counting. Students have lost the morale to read or study. 
The concern of this software is to help students to study consistently over time by delivering academic summaries to their email daily. 
Students who spend 20 mins daily going through the academic summary sent to their email will have a higher advantage when the strike is called off.

# How does this work?
I will like to approach this based on a step-by-step procedure.

1. Any student can create an account on the platform.
2. If the student is interested in only receiving academic newsletters, the student can find a group that serves her interest and subscribe. 
3. If a student or lecturer is interested in creating academic summaries and sharing them, The first step is to create an account on the platform.
4. The second step is to create a group, thus making your group open for subscription to students who share a similar interest in that particular field.
5. If the group creator (main admin) needs more hands to help create content he can open her group to other administrators to apply. 
6. When an application is accepted, the applicant becomes a sub-admin of the group applied to.
7. When a sub-admin posts, the main admin must approve the post before it gets sent out as a newsletter to all subscribers.
8. The main admin can create a custom message to use and welcome new subscribers to the group.


### Technical Structure

This app is divided into two different sections which are 'the frontend' and 'the backend'. 

#### The frontend stack
- HTML -CSS -Bootstrap -JS -Vue
#### The backend stack
- Python -DJango -Django Rest Framework - Celery -Rabit MQ

The purpose of the frontend is to illustrate and give easy interaction with the REST API implementation of the APP.The main focus is on the REST API implementation.


# How to set up this project.

I reccommend you start by setting up the backend.
Instructions can be found in the README.md in the backend folder, same applies to the frontend.
